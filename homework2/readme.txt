compiling and running:
1) call make
2) run as follows:
	./proxy <port>


***THIS CODE IS INCOMPLETE***

I was able to complete steps 1 - 3 of the tips segment of the assignment.
I have placed both the client and server code in one file (proxy.c).
However, I am not able to load a website (I still am able to make a request to the web server and store respose in a file (proxy.log)).
This implementation is iterative.

NOTE: you must configure your web browser proxy to "localhost" on the port that you want to run this code on
