compiling and running:

***WHAT I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED***

This code can currently load basic html pages. Pages that I am able to successfully upload are:
		www.gnu.org
		www.jmarshall.com

However, this code is not able to run with more complex websites, such as www.ucsb.edu. The result of 
running these sites are partial HTML, but lack of CSS.

NOTE: you must configure your web browser proxy to "localhost" on the port that you want to run this code on
